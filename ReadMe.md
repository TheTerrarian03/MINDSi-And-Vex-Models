## Confused? Where to go:

So you're looking at this and you're overwhelmed and confused on where to go. Let's fix that!

### Models

The [`Models/Vex/` folder](./Models/VEX/) will have pre-made 3D models for VEX parts that you may need replacements of. Such as Pulleys or Gears or Bushings for axles.

The [`Models/MINDSi/` folder](./Models/MINDSi/) will have pre-made 3D models for MINDSi parts you may need replacements of. A lot of the parts you need to buy again from the official site cost a lot more than they should, so if you're okay with a small durability decrease (from injection moulding to FDM 3D Printing), you can achieve the same function for a fraction of the price. And in a pinch, too!

The [`Models/Interfaces/` folder](./Models/Interfaces/) will have pre-made 3D printable parts you can use to interface between the MINDSi and VEX ecosystems. Keep in mind they may only fit niche use cases or could still have issues yet to be fixed! Suggestions for improvements are always welcome.

In this folder I have models for certain beams, mounts, plates, covers, etc. The most important ones would probably be the Steering Bar and Servo Mount.

In both of the models folders i will also include the `.FCStd` files for each model so you can edit them or make adjsutments! This is supposed to be Open Source after all. Then of course there will be the exported, 3d-printing ready, `.stl` files.

If you'd like to 3D model some custom parts, I have some info and tips that might be helpful in the [`Models/3D Modeling Resources.md` file](./Models/3D%20Modeling%20Resources.md).

### Robot Maintenance

If you find yourself in need of robot repairs, here's some options.

- **Pre-Made 3D Printable replacements:** ask Mr. U or another teacher to print the pieces you need
- **Custom 3D printable replacements:** Using programs like Fusion 360, Inventor, FreeCAD, Ondsel ES, or even Onshape, you can create your own parts to fix your robot or improve its functionality! (Then have someone print it)
- **Purchase-Only Consumables and Electronics:** if you find things like batteries, speed controller, servos, etc are wearing down or breaking, you'll need to communicate to Mr. U or another teacher that you need replacements and they should add them to an order for you.

### Coding and Controls

If you find yourself in need of help with coding, there are resources to help, without having to talk to mny people if you're an introvert like I am, or stubborn like I am :\)

- **Official MINDSi Programming Guide:** the first place to start would be the official guide provided by MINDSi. You should have the "Arduino User Guide" booklet in your kit, but it is available online at this link: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0048/7129/0950/files/Arduino_User_Guide.pdf?v=1600981701.
- **Some Tips and Experience from Myself:** in the [`MINDSi Resources` folder](./MINDSi%20Resources/) there are some resources there to help I've put together myself. There is a Markdown file ([`Code Resources.md`](./MINDSi%20Resources/Code%20Resources.md)) that explains some things and gives some tips, and there are code examples in the [`Example Code` folder](./MINDSi%20Resources/Example%20Code/) you may want to take a look at for inspiration or if you're stuck.
- **Peers:** Don't forget! You have fellow peers and programming wizards in your class with you, so if all else fails I recommend asking them for help!

## How to Contribute

Like this repository and want to help make it better? Or update it as time goes on and Mr. U's classes naturally evolve over time?

Anyone is welcome to clone this repository, make changes, and make a pull request. Me and possibly Mr. U will have control over this repo, so one of us can accept or reject PR's.

Same thing goes with models I've made in the past which you then edit to make work better for the future classes. My models and spreadsheets and resources are meant to be for the future classes! So, I'm happy to accept PR's to update this repo.

Also, anyone is welcome to download and use, and edit my models, including the .FCStd files (that's why they're there after all).

And frankly I'm not going to bother with copyright stuff as of time of writing, but even though this is all technically owned by me because I'm hosting the repo, you're welcoem to do whatever you want with this stuff!
